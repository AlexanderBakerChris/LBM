This Matlab code aims at solving Lattice Botlzmann Method (LBM) in a 2D channel flow.
The goal is to observe how well different LBM methods for capturing a curved wall bounadry condition behave.
The benchmark is chosen to be the drag coefficient obtained from flow over a cylinder, while different methods are applied to capture the curved boundary.
